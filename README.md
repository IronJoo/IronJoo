### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Joana and I am a Java trainee at ISCTE - Instituto UniversitÃ¡rio de Lisboa through the program <a href="https://upskill.pt/" target="blank">UpSkill - Digital Skills & Jobs</a>. I am simultaneously attending <a href="https://www.42lisboa.com/">42 Lisboa</a> where I study C language.

At ISCTE, I am undergoing an intensive 6-month Java programming course + internship which includes the following modules:
-Java programming language (completed)
-Database concepts and structures (completed)
<b>-Concurrent programming (in progress)</b>
-Principles of software development
-Programming lab

Check out one my favorite creative projects I got to work on: <a href="https://github.com/IronJoo/Rogue_UPskill2022_v1_Joana_Ferro">Rogue</a>

This is a rogue-like game that features the following:
-Multiple rooms
-Enemies that follow the hero when close
-Randomly generated traps and grass on the floor
-Traps cause damage
-Picked up items are added to the hero's inventory, up to a maximum of three
-Health bar dynamically displays the hero's health
-Locked doors can only be opened with a specific key
-Descriptive status messages at the bottom of the page give insights of what's occuring in the game
